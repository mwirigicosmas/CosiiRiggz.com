<p>Bata shoe company retail Nyeri
    I increased sales by having good customer relationships which led to customers begin loyal and coming back to buy more.
    I helped in suggesting layout designs that were appealing to customers.
    I increased sales by going on field work to search for customers who would buy shoes and other accessories.
    I also increased sales as I would encourage my fellow friends and contacts to shop at Bata and show them our quality products
